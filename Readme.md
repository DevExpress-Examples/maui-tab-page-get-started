The **DevExpress Mobile UI for Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI** is free of charge. To learn more about our offer and to reserve your copy, visit [Free DevExpress Mobile UI for Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI](https://www.devexpress.com/xamarin-free).

## Requirements

You can also refer to the following YouTube video for more information on how to get started with the DevExpress .NET MAUI Controls: [Setting up a .NET MAUI Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juJvl5UicIQ).

## What's in This Repository

In v22.1.1-pre-22115, the **DevExpress Mobile UI for .NET MAUI** suite does not include the `TabPage`, `DrawerPage`, and `DrawerView` components that were supported in previous previews. See the following breaking change for more information: [Navigation controls for .NET MAUI have been removed](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/internal/ticket/details/T1085745).

This example shows how to replace the `TabPage` with the `TabView` to implement a similar functionality. See the following pull request for changes: [Replace TabPage with TabView](https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/maui-tab-page-get-started/pull/3/files).

### Populate a TabPage Manually

The [CreateTabItemsManually](./CS/CreateTabItemsManually/) project explains how to use the [TabPage](http://docs.devexpress.com/MAUI/DevExpress.Maui.Controls.TabPage) component with manually created tab items to implement bottom tab navigation in a .NET MAUI application.

### Generate Items

The [GenerateTabItemsFromDataSource](./CS/GenerateTabItemsFromDataSource/) project explains how to use the [TabPage](http://docs.devexpress.com/MAUI/DevExpress.Maui.Controls.TabPage) component with tab items generated from a data source to create a tab bar that allows users to filter lists.
